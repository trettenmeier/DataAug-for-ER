# Examples
This folder contains various examples how to use SentenceTransformers.

## Datasets
The [datasets](datasets/) folder stores datasets that are used in these examples. To download these datasets, run in the dataset folder:
```
python get_data.py
```


## Applications
The [applications](applications/) folder contains examples how to use SentenceTransformers for tasks like clustering or semantic search.

## Training Transformers
The [training_transformers](training_transformers/) folder contains examples how to fine-tune transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, or XLM-RoBERTa for generating sentence embedding.

Further, it contains examples for **multi-task-learning**, **multilingual-learning** and **custom-loss-learning** such as the **BatchHardTripletLoss**.

## Training Basic Models
The [training_basic_models](training_basic_models/) show some examples how to train simple models like average word embeddings, Tf-Idf. Further, it has some more complex models based on Deep Averaging Networks (DAN), CNN, and LSTM.

These example are great if a high speed for sentence embedding generation is needed.

## Evaluation
The [evaluation](evaluation/) folder contains some examples how to evaluate SentenceTransformer models for common tasks.
